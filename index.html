      During pharmacy restructure, solved problems and made recommendations for new specialty services - In 2012, this pharmacy transitioned from being an independent Specialty Pharmacy (Bioscrip) to Walgreens. The location of this pharmacy in downtown Baltimore, MD, we are directly next to University of Maryland Medical System and next to the Veteran’s Administration Hospital. Our new Specialty pharmacy services were providing complex pharmaceuticals for mail order and in-person services, were highly complex with the new Specialty Pharmacy program.
      <br><br>
      As the sole Pharmacy Technician, I implemented new computer systems, received training and diligence during the transferring of patient information. Worked closely with corporate office. Resolved inventory discrepancies with the new computer system; worked closely with corporate office and supervisor to correct errors and ensure proper tracking. Provided a seamless transition for customers by contacting their insurance providers and doctors to confirm their prescriptions were still covered. Ensured continuous access to critical data and accurate tracking of inventory and orders.
      <br><br>
      As the only pharmacy technician in this organization, attained urac accreditation and improved systems: URAC (Utilization Review Accreditation Commission)is a respected accreditation, given by an independent, non-for-profit leader in healthcare quality, and is a symbol of excellence in the industry, validated commitment to quality and accountability. Quality services and improving business processes through benchmarking
      organizations against nationally recognized standards.
      <br><br>
      Improved quality of services for specialty pharmacy: I recommended and improved many internal systems in order to attain the accreditation in cooperation with our 3 Pharmacists. Many central specialty pharmacies have received URAC accreditation, but very few community-based specialty pharmacies in the industry have been able to obtain this honor. Our unique Community pharmacy is paving the way, not only in unparalleled access to medications and
      personalized service, but also in being granted this prestigious accreditation.
      <br><br>
      The goal of this obtaining this accreditation for specialty patients is to improve patient outcomes. Walgreens independent URAC accreditation shows a dedication to patient education and safety. URAC accreditation, people know that Walgreens strives to adhere to industry best practices. URAC accreditation requires applicants to submit clinical and operational procedures, quality
      assurance processes, and other organizational information to URAC for review. Generally takes 4-5 months to gain URAC approval as meeting their standards
      <br><br>
      The next step is 1-2 day onsite audit by a URAC reviewer to evaluate pharmacy operations, clinical patient care, clinical documentation, and quality. Once accreditation is granted, every 3 years pharmacies need to reapply and recomplete the whole process to keep this highly esteemed
      accreditation.

      <br><br>
      Follow written instructions for compounding - Provided exceptional customer service to an elderly customer with multiple chronic diseases. Prior to contacting our pharmacy, she had been going to 4 different pharmacies to fill various prescriptions. I worked diligently with distributors and her insurance provider to ensure our pharmacy could fill all 15 specialty medications; successfully completed the order in less than a week. Contacted doctors, Medicare and insurance provider to ensure medications were covered and cost to customer was accurate. Upon being notified that her new insurance provider would not cover her nebulizer, worked with manager to arrange donation of one to the customer.
      <br><br>
      Recently, I received a call from my friend (who’s baby son of 3 years, recipient of a bone marrow transplant from his father) asking if we knew of any pharmacy that could compound the drug Prograf in liquid form for today. The call was on Sunday morning during the weekend when almost every pharmacy is closed, and we’re not available to provide the help, since the store is open Monday through Friday 9:00am - 5:30pm. However, besides my responsibility as a friend I also felt it was my responsibility as a Pharmacy Technician to help. I immediately spoke with the pharmacy manager to see what he would recommend; he informed me that he would be able to compound the medication if I could find the ingredients from a local 24-hour Walgreens. Following the recipe for the compound instruction, I was able to find all the ingredients. As a result we were able to fill the prescription and the patient was able to receive the medication timely.
